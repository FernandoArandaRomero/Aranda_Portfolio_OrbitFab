# Fernando Aranda Romero - Engineering Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I showcase my engineering portfolio and supporting materials. This repository is intended for potential employers and collaborators to gain insights into my skills, projects, and engineering approach.

## Portfolio Overview

The portfolio, accessible as a PDF in this repository, encapsulates my expertise and contributions in the field of space engineering. It includes detailed accounts of my academic projects, focusing on various subsystems involved in satellite development. Key highlights:

- **D.U.S.T.I.N. Project**: An in-depth study of Martian dust storms, employing a systems engineering approach. (Note: The report for this project is still in the finalization stage and will be uploaded upon completion.)
- **Other Projects**: Reverse engineering, guidance and navigation studies, propulsion design comparisons, CubeSat control architecture, and more.

## Repository Structure

- `Aranda_Portfolio.pdf`: My complete engineering portfolio in PDF format.
- `Supporting_Material`: A folder containing detailed reports for each project mentioned in the portfolio, except for the D.U.S.T.I.N. project, which is currently being finalized.

### Note on Confidentiality
Due to confidentiality agreements, certain details of my role as a Payload Team Member and Intern are not disclosed in this portfolio.
