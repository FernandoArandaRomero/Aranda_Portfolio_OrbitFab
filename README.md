# Fernando Aranda's Astroscale Satellite Systems Engineer Job Application Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I showcase my engineering portfolio and supporting materials. This repository is created for my application at Astroscale Japan to gain insights into my skills, projects, and engineering approach.

## Portfolio Overview

The portfolio, accessible as a PDF in this repository called "Aranda_Portfolio", includes detailed accounts of my academic projects, focusing on various subsystems involved in satellite development. Key highlights:

- **D.U.S.T.I.N. Project**: An in-depth study of Martian dust storms, employing a systems engineering approach. (Note: The report for this project is still in the finalization stage and will be uploaded upon completion.)
- **Other Projects**: Reverse engineering, guidance and navigation studies, propulsion design comparisons, CubeSat control architecture, and more.

## Repository Structure

- `Aranda_Portfolio.pdf`: My complete engineering portfolio in PDF format.
- `Supporting_Material`: A folder containing detailed reports for each project mentioned in the portfolio, except for the D.U.S.T.I.N. project, which is currently being finalized.
